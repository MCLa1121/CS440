/**
 * <p>Represents a function which punishes/pleasures your model according to how well the {@link Action}s its been
 * choosing have been. Your reward function could calculate R(s), R(s,a), or (R,s,a'): whichever is easiest for you to
 * think about (for instance does it make more sense to you to evaluate behavior when you see a state, the action you
 * took in that state, and how that action resolved? If so you want to pick R(s,a,s')).
 *
 * <p>By default this is configured to calculate R(s). If you want to change this you need to change the
 * {@link RewardType} enum in the constructor *and* you need to implement the corresponding method. Refer to
 * {@link RewardFunction} and {@link RewardType} for more details.
